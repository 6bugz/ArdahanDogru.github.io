CS491 Senior Design Project - Fakenstein

Fakenstein is an Android and desktop application that aims to protect the privacy of the people present in photographs without their consent. The application will first identify the background faces in a given image and then replace the selected faces with computer-generated faces. This goal will be achieved by using Machine Learning models, which will be used to detect faces in the background and generate appropriate artificial faces that match the person's appearance and pose. Available applications require the users to spend their time and effort to either remove the people or blur their faces which causes the photograph to look edited and unrealistic. However, Fakenstein will protect the privacy of the people while reducing the time needed from the users and preserving the natural look of the photographs.
